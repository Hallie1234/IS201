                        <p>As a Master's of Public Administration student at Brigham Young University, I have combined my passion for women's empowerment and finance. I am particularly enthusiastic about the emerging "micro-loan" programs in developing countries and their success in supporting impoverished women to become successful entrepreneurs.</p>
                        <p>Microloans have the potential to empower women and help them break the cycle of poverty. In many developing countries, women face significant barriers to accessing credit, such as limited education, lack of collateral, and cultural biases. As a result, women often find themselves in vulnerable positions, unable to invest in their businesses or provide for their families.</p>
                        <p>Microloans are small loans provided to individuals, typically in developing countries, who lack access to traditional banking services. These loans can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand and are usually provided by microfinance institutions or non-governmental organizations. Women are often the primary beneficiaries of microloans, as they are more likely to invest in their businesses, use the funds to improve their livelihoods, and pay back the loans.</p>
                        <p>Microloans can be used to start or expand a business, purchase necessary equipment or inventory, or cover unexpected expenses. By providing women with access to credit, microloans can help them increase their income, improve their standard of living, and become more financially independent. This, in turn, can lead to increased confidence, greater decision-making power, and improved social standing within their communities.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the economic benefits, microloans can also have a positive impact on women's social and emotional well-being. By giving women the opportunity to contribute to their households and communities, microloans can help them gain a sense of purpose and pride. They can also provide a support network and a sense of community among borrowers, which can help combat feelings of isolation and despair.</p>
                        <p>Overall, microloans have the potential to empower women and help them break the cycle of poverty. By providing access to credit, women can invest in their businesses, increase their income, and become more financially independent. This, in turn, can lead to improved social and emotional well-being and greater participation in their communities.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Passion with Potential</h2>
                        <p>As a student in BYU's MPA Program, I have acquired a set of skills that will enable me to pursue a career in micro-loan finance with confidence. I have learned how to conduct effective quantitative decision analysis, carry out program evaluation studies, and gained expertise in public finance, among other areas. This summer, I will be interning with Goldman Sachs, where I will have the opportunity to further refine my finance acumen. With these skills, I will be able to pursue a career in this burgeoning field or pursue it as a passion project.</p>
